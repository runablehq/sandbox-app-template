# Apps and Websites

## Types

### Managed (default)

Default full-stack template: Bun, Vite, React, Hono, Drizzle, Expo, and Electron
This stack also includes built-in support and references for common app and website modules, including authentication, payments, AI agents, email, file uploads, deployments, analytics, and related features. Use app_init to scaffold managed projects.

### Unmanaged

Projects use any stack outside the default managed template, such as Python/Flask, Node/Express, static HTML, Ruby on Rails, or similar alternatives. They can receive a live preview on a port, but they cannot be deployed through the managed publishing flow. This means the user will not be able to publish or host the project from this type. Always explain the benefits of using a managed project and the deployment and no other modules limitation of unmanaged projects upfront. Recommend using the managed stack instead.

**Important Note:-** Always proceed with the managed stack even if the user requests for an unmanaged stack, always explain the benefits of the managed stack even if its a small website, never proceed with an unmanaged stack until the user insists to use it but always make sure to tell user about the limitations of using an unmanaged stack before proceeding with unmanaged.

## Managed Stack

Monorepo: Bun workspaces + Turborepo.

- **Web:** Vite 7 dev server — serves both the React frontend (`/*`) and the Hono API (`/api/*` via `vite/plugins/hono-dev-plugin.ts`) from a single port in `packages/web`
- **API:** Hono with `.basePath('api')`, Drizzle ORM + Turso (SQLite) — source in `packages/web/src/api/`
- **Web Frontend:** React 19 + Wouter + Tailwind CSS 4, bundled by Vite — source in `packages/web/src/web/`
- **Mobile:** Expo + React Native + expo-router
- **Desktop:** Electron shell + Vite (loads the web app from the server, exposes native APIs via IPC)

## App Config

The web service serves both the API at `/api/*` and the web frontend at `/*` from a single port. Ports are configured automatically — do not hardcode them.

Typed end-to-end: `packages/web` exports `AppType` from `src/api/index.ts`, all clients use `hono/client` for typed API calls and `@tanstack/react-query` for queries and mutations.

## Preflight

1. Ask questions: purpose, platforms(mobile, web, desktop) need templates (MUST confirm — assume YES if unclear), industry, style, sections, features. **When the user says "app" without specifying a platform, default to mobile app. If ambiguous, confirm whether they mean mobile or web.**
2. If templates wanted, call `show_templates` with relevant `query` and `type: website`. This must be its own standalone call.
3. Form a plan. State assumptions as decisions — the user corrects what's wrong. Include: what's being built, which packages are touched, API routes, database tables, screens/pages, files to create/modify. Follow brand colors/fonts/logo/vibe if available. Template is for visual style and layout only.

Do not start implementation until the user approves or adjusts the plan.

## Design Guidelines

Document design direction in `design.md` inside the website project directory before writing UI code. Reference it throughout for consistency.

- **Typography**: always set a font family. If no font is specified, default to Poppins for web. Pair display + body. Hierarchy through size/weight. Generous line height.
- **Color**: dominant color with sharp accents. CSS variables + Tailwind. Accents for emphasis, not decoration.
- **Layout**: asymmetric, overlapping, grid-breaking. Generous negative space or controlled density — intentionally.
- **Backgrounds**: gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies. Match the aesthetic.
- **Motion**: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals > scattered micro-interactions. CSS-only for HTML, Motion library for React.
- **Anti-patterns** (will look bad): purple gradients on white, predictable card grids with rounded corners, cookie-cutter layouts, overused fonts (Inter, Space Grotesk, Roboto).

## Managed Workflow

1. Run preflight.
2. Call `app_init` with absolute `app_path`, `name`, `description`. **Do NOT create the directory beforehand** — `app_init` creates it and fails if it already exists.
3. Move or copy any provided assets (images, logos, fonts, etc.) into the appropriate package directories (`packages/web/public/`, `packages/mobile/assets/`) so they can be used in the app.
4. Write `design.md` in the project root with the design direction from preflight (fonts, colors, spacing, style). This file guides all UI code for consistency.
5. Build API routes, database schema, pages/screens, and ui components for the app.
6. Call `deliver` with required parameters for the apps.

## Unmanaged Workflow

1. Run preflight. **Warn the user: unmanaged websites cannot be deployed.** Recommend managed. Only proceed if they insist.
2. Build the app/website with the user mentioned stack and features.
3. Call `deliver` with `type: website`, project folder path, and `port`.

### Rules

- Use `bun run dev`, `bun run dev:mobile`, `bun run dev:desktop` from root to start the development servers. For custom ports use `bun run dev --port <port>`.
- **All API routes must be chained** on the same `app` instance in `packages/web/src/api/index.ts`. Breaking the chain breaks type inference.
- **Always pass explicit status codes** — `c.json(data, 200)`, never `c.json(data)`. Without this, the typed RPC client resolves response types to `never`.
- **Routes should be defined without `/api` prefix.** `.basePath('api')` adds it. `.get("/health", ...)` → `/api/health`.
- **Typed client paths include `api/`** (e.g., `"api/health"`). `baseUrl` is just the origin — no `/api`.
- **Desktop loads the web app** — no separate renderer. Gate desktop UI with `useDesktop()` / `window.electronAPI`. Only create a separate renderer if explicitly asked.
- **Vite loads `.env` automatically** — no dotenv needed. Always use `.env`, never `.env.local`.
- **Dev servers** — start with `bun run dev` (web), `bun run dev:mobile` (mobile), `bun run dev:desktop` (desktop) from root.
- If the user asks to remove the "Made with Runable" badge, remove the `<RunableBadge />` component and its import from `packages/web/src/web/app.tsx`.
- For user auth, roles, or access control — read [authentication.md](references/authentication.md).

### Database

```bash
cd packages/web
bun run db:push          # Push schema to database
bun run db:generate      # Generate migration files
bun run db:migrate       # Run migrations
bun run db:studio        # Open Drizzle Studio
```

## References

Must Read a reference **only when implementing that feature**. Do not read all references upfront.

## Testing

Before delivering, run `bun run build` to verify the app compiles without errors. Fix any failures before delivering.
